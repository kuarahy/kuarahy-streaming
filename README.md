A local notification system for streamers

# Stack
React FrontEnd, Go Lang Back End, all around awesomeness ðŸ˜ŽðŸš€

## The Problem
If you ever streamed from any service, the notification system is usually unreliable. That is related to server latency, service latency, or others. By cutting out the parts of the system that aren't interesting for a streamer, this alleviates that and simplifies the process. You won't need to login to a service for it, no bloated software, no advertisement, no platform. You use a neat little frontend browser locally installed for you to setup your notifications, and that's it.

## ToDo

[ ] React Installation </br>
[ ] API Secret Testing </br>
[ ] Question: do we even need a client secret since this is all local? </br>
[ ] React FrontEnd </br>
[ ] Sound Config component </br>
[ ] GoReleaser Config for packaging </br>
[ ] Question: Am I using NSIS Installer for Windows? Are we releasing this for macOS in 1.0? </br>
